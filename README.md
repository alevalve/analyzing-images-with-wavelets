# Decomposition of images using Wavelet

This script demonstrates the use of Wavelets in image decomposition using DB4 and Haar.

## Prerequisites

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- pywt
- scipy (fftpack and signal)
- cv2
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Description

The wavelet decomposition has the following:

1. Load the MonaLisa.jpg.
2. Preprocess the images by resizing and converting them to grayscale.
3. Build the Fourier fucntion to apply this method.
4. Build the Wavelet function to apply to the images
5. Display the images using the 3 decomposition methods.
